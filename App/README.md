# Auslanderbehorde Berlin Appointment search automation (Windows only)

## Overview

This Python project provides a script to automate the process of booking appointments online. It leverages the Selenium package to interact with web pages and perform actions such as filling out forms, clicking buttons, and navigating through the appointment booking process.

## Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio. To all the people in Berlin suffering through the pain of not being able to find an appointment at Auslanderbehorde(Visa Office). If you are here to get help finding appointment then you must know how it is almost impossible to get an appointment at Auslanderbehorde and most of the time you end up writing them a mail and wait for several months or pay for an appointment to a third party. I have made this [Python program](#download) to help you find an appointment at Auslanderbehorde. The program is still in the making, a lot of new ideas, features, accessibilities, options and improvements are undergo but this is the basic version made only to look for the ***Job-Seeking visa*** at the moment.

## Requirements

## Usage

As mentioned above the app is still undergoing development and is limited to only a few features yet. The app only works for application of job-seekers visa appointment i.e Apply for the residence title: Job-seekers visa. Be aware that the program only navigates to the appointment service automatically and auto refreshes until any appointment appears when the notification sound goes off so it can also run in the background or not to be attended to.
The application is only available for Windows 10 or 11 OS yet. Please follow the following steps to get familiar with the application and its usage:

- Download the [application.exe](#download) file
- The app has a cli interface and only interacts with cli
- Save the app on your local system and run the App.exe file
- A command prompt window will appear and the program will start running on your machine
- The first step is checking for chrome and webdriver(Chrome driver)
- Please make sure to download [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and the [webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) same as the chrome's version
- The program will run its second step and check for the version of the webdriver if its compatible with your installed chrome version
- The program will provide you with further instructions to make sure that the webdriver is compatible with the chrome
- Please do not type or close the window until the program asks you to do so
- The program will then request your information
- Your nationality is required to be your country name without any suffixes or prefixes in German. You can find your country name in German [here](https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/countrynames_german.htm) (Please only use the German name to avoid any interruptions)
- Number of people applying should be at least one and maximum eight in number(ex:1,2,3...)
- Family members functionality is not fully accessible so please type "No" or just press enter. As for now this option is only available for "No" input
- Please don't hurry or type anything else until the program says to, just wait for it to process.
- The program then will open the chrome window and start the automation process
- You must not do anything afterwards, the program will keep running until it finds you the appointment window and notify you with a notification sound for 30 seconds so please make sure your windows volume is loud enough for you to catch up on that sound
- Once the appointment window appears you can book your appointment and close the program
